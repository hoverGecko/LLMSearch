# LLMSearch
LLMSearch is a cross-platform web-searching application that fetches and processes multiple batches of search results from search engine APIs, summarizes the results using LLMs and presents the results to the user in the format of traditional search engines.

## How to run
### Frontend
Under [frontend/](frontend/), run `npm i` to install the necessary modules, then run `npm run web` to start the web development server.
### Backend
Running the backend locally requires AWS SAM to be installed.
Under [backend/llm-search/main/](backend/llm-search/main/), run `npm i` to install the necessary modules.
Then, run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

## Current Progress
- Creating backend stub - done
- Creating frontend prototype
